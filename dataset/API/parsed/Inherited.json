This process will be repeated until an annotation for this\n type is found, or the top of the class hierarchy (Object)\n is reached.  If no superclass has an annotation for this type, then\n the query will indicate that the class in question has no such annotation.\n\n Note that this meta-annotation type has no effect if the annotated\n type is used to annotate anything other than a class.
