Instead, as\n is the case for nearly all fork/join applications, you'd pick some\n minimum granularity size (for example 10 here) for which you always\n sequentially solve rather than subdividing.", "codes": ["public abstract class RecursiveTask<V>\nextends ForkJoinTask<V>"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "compute", "method_sig": "protected abstract V compute()", "description": "The main computation performed by this task."}, {"method_name": "exec", "method_sig": "protected final boolean exec()", "description": "Implements execution conventions for RecursiveTask."}]}
